### üöÄ What is a **Kubernetes Service**?

In **Kubernetes**, a **Service** is an **abstraction** which defines a **logical set of Pods** and a **policy by which to access them**‚Äîusually via a stable network endpoint.

Pods in Kubernetes are ephemeral. They can die and be recreated, and when they do, their IP addresses can change. A **Service** gives a consistent way to access those pods‚Äîno matter how many times the pods change.

### ‚úÖ Why Do We Need a Service?
Imagine you have a **Deployment** that runs multiple replicas of an **Nginx pod**. Each pod will have a different IP address. If a client wants to access Nginx, how does it know which pod IP to use?

A **Kubernetes Service** solves this problem by:
- Giving a **stable virtual IP (ClusterIP) or DNS name**
- Acting as a **load balancer** to route traffic to the right pods (based on labels)

### üîß Types of Kubernetes Services

| Type           | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| `ClusterIP`    | Default. Exposes the service on a cluster-internal IP. Only accessible within the cluster. |
| `NodePort`     | Exposes the service on a static port on each Node's IP. Accessible from outside the cluster using `<NodeIP>:<NodePort>`. |
| `LoadBalancer` | Exposes the service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. |
| `ExternalName` | Maps a service to an external DNS name. |

### üì¶ Nginx Service Example

Let‚Äôs walk through a real example of deploying an Nginx app with a Kubernetes **Service**.

#### Step 1: Create an Nginx Deployment
```yaml
# nginx-deployment.yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

> This creates 3 replicas of an Nginx pod, each listening on port 80.

---

#### Step 2: Expose with a Kubernetes Service
```yaml
# nginx-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80       # Exposed port
    targetPort: 80 # Container port
  type: ClusterIP
```

> This Service selects pods with label `app=nginx` and forwards traffic on port 80 to their port 80.

---

#### üß™ Step 3: Test the Service (Inside Cluster)
Run a test pod to `curl` the service:
```bash
kubectl run testbox --rm -it --image=busybox -- /bin/sh
wget -qO- http://nginx-service
```

You should see the Nginx welcome page HTML.

---

### üîÅ Changing to NodePort (Access Outside Cluster)
```yaml
# nginx-service-nodeport.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-nodeport-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - port: 80
      targetPort: 80
      nodePort: 30080  # accessible via <NodeIP>:30080
```

Now you can access Nginx from outside using `http://<NodeIP>:30080`.

---

### üåê LoadBalancer Example (Cloud Only)
For cloud-based clusters like AWS or Azure:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: nginx-loadbalancer
spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
```

> The cloud provider will provision an external IP that routes to your Nginx pods.

---

### üß† Summary

- A **Service** gives a **stable IP** and **DNS** to access a **group of pods**.
- It decouples the frontend (client) from backend pod IPs.
- You can use **ClusterIP**, **NodePort**, or **LoadBalancer** types based on how you want it accessed.
